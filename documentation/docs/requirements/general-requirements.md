# General Requirements

## Project goals

* Make Web Prototyping more accessible by enabling contributions from both experience and new users.
* Reduce the time and expertise required to transform an idea into a working UI prototype.
* Provide a collaborative environment that will support team-based projects and inspire creativity.
* Bridge the gap between userâ€™s ideal and practical implementation.

## Users and Stakeholders

* Creators/Designers: Generate sketches and contribute ideas.
* Non-technical users: Build prototypes without the need of deep coding knowledge.
* Developers: Exports code for further integration into their product.
* Organizations/Teams: Benefit from faster prototyping and cross-collaboration functionality.

## User Assumptions and Constraints

* Users require internet access and modern browsers.
* AI-powered recognition and code generation rely on external services.
* Real-time collaboration requires synchronization across multiple participants.
* Focus is limited to UI design and generation (no backend software).
* System must support simultaneous editing without significant lag.

## Risks

* Variability in quality due to reliance on AI.
* Real-time collaboration may face challenges with large groups.
* Recognition issues with unclear or complex sketches.

## Success Criteria

* Usability validated by non-technical users producing working prototypes with minimal guidance.
* Effective real-time collaboration with multiple concurrent users.
* AI-generated output is directly usable in standard development environments. 
* Reduced prototyping time compared to conventional design and coding.
