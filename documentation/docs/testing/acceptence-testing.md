# Acceptance Testing

Demonstration of all of the functional and non-functional requirements. This can be a combination of automated tests derived from the use-cases (user stories) and manual tests with recorded observation of the results.

**Note:** This project is in early development. All results below represent expected outcomes and have not yet been tested.

---

## Functional Requirements

| Test ID | Action/Steps | Expected Result | Pass/Fail/Skip | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| S2S-1 | **Create New Workspace**<br />‣ Navigate to the Sketch2Screen homepage<br />‣ Click "Create New Workspace" button | System generates a unique workspace ID and shareable link. User is redirected to the sketch canvas with drawing tools available. | | |
| S2S-2 | **Join Existing Workspace**<br />‣ Receive workspace link/code from workspace creator<br />‣ Enter the workspace code or click the shared link on homepage | System validates the code, loads the workspace with current canvas state, and displays existing sketches from other collaborators. WebSocket notifies active users of new collaborator. | | |
| S2S-3 | **Draw and Collaborate in Real-Time**<br />‣ Select a drawing tool from the toolbar (pen, shapes, text)<br />‣ Draw UI component sketches on the canvas<br />‣ Observe other collaborators drawing simultaneously | Drawing strokes appear on all collaborators' canvases in real-time. System automatically saves the canvas state. Multiple users can draw simultaneously without conflicts. | | |
| S2S-4 | **Generate AI Components**<br />‣ Complete sketching UI components on canvas<br />‣ Click the "Generate" button | System displays loading indicator and processes sketches. AI model returns multiple component variations for each sketch element. Selection interface displays all generated options. | | |
| S2S-5 | **Select Component Variations**<br />‣ Review the AI-generated component variations<br />‣ Click on preferred versions of each component<br />‣ Click to apply selected components" | Selected components are highlighted in the interface. System prepares selected components and transitions to design mode. | | |
| S2S-6 | **Arrange Components in Design Mode**<br />‣ Drag and drop components to desired positions<br />‣ Resize components using drag handles<br />‣ Use alignment guides for precise positioning | Components move and resize smoothly. Alignment guides and snap-to-grid assist with positioning. System automatically saves design state after changes. | | |
| S2S-7 | **Export Design as Code**<br />‣ Click button to export in design mode<br />‣ Select desired framework from dialog<br />‣ Confirm export selection | Export dialog displays framework options. System generates code files for selected framework and initiates download. Success confirmation message appears. | | |
| S2S-8 | **Save and Resume Workspace**<br />‣ Work in workspace for an extended period<br />‣ Close browser and return to workspace URL later | System periodically auto-saves workspace state. Returning to workspace URL loads complete state including sketches, selected components, and design layout. | | |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Test ID | Action/Steps | Expected Result | Pass/Fail/Skip | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| S2S-9 | **Cross-Browser Compatibility**<br />‣ Access application from various browsers<br />‣ Perform core actions (create workspace, draw, generate components) | Application functions correctly across all modern browsers with consistent behavior and appearance. | | |
| S2S-10 | **Real-Time Collaboration Performance**<br />‣ Have 4+ users simultaneously drawing in the same workspace<br />‣ Monitor latency and synchronization | Real-time updates maintain low latency. No data loss or merge conflicts occur during simultaneous editing. | | |
| S2S-11 | **AI Generation Performance**<br />‣ Generate components from sketches of varying complexity<br />‣ Measure processing time for small and large sketches | AI processing completes within reasonable timeframe. Loading indicator provides feedback during processing. | | |
| S2S-12 | **Application Performance Under Load**<br />‣ Load workspace with 25+ saved sketches and components<br />‣ Perform drawing, component generation, and design operations<br />‣ Monitor system responsiveness | Workspace loads within 5 seconds. Application maintains smooth performance during all interactions with no memory leaks or degradation. | | |
| S2S-13 | **Input Device Compatibility**<br />‣ Test drawing functionality using mouse on desktop<br />‣ Test drawing functionality using touch input on tablet/mobile | Both mouse and touch gestures register accurately for drawing and all interface interactions. | | |
| S2S-14 | **Code Quality and Standards**<br />‣ Review all generated code<br />‣ Validate code structure and formatting | Generated code follows framework best practices, is properly formatted, semantic, and accessible. | | |

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

| Test ID | Action/Steps | Expected Result | Pass/Fail/Skip | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| S2S-15 | **Invalid Workspace Handling**<br />‣ Enter invalid workspace code or click broken link<br />‣ Attempt to access deleted workspace | System displays appropriate error messages ("Workspace not found" or "This workspace is no longer available") and redirects to homepage. | | |
| S2S-16 | **Network Disconnection Recovery**<br />‣ Draw on canvas while connected<br />Simulate network disconnection<br />Continue drawing offline<br />‣ Restore network connection | System queues drawing data locally and displays "Connection lost" indicator. Upon reconnection, queued changes sync automatically to backend and collaborators. | | |
| S2S-17 | **AI Generation Error Handling**<br />‣ Attempt to generate components from empty/minimal sketch<br />‣ Simulate AI service failure during generation | System displays helpful error messages: "No UI components detected. Please add more detail to your sketch." or "Generation failed. Please try again." User can retry or modify sketch. | | |
| S2S-18 | **Export Error Handling**<br />‣ Attempt to export empty design with no components<br />‣ Simulate code generation failure | System displays appropriate error messages: "No components to export. Please add components first." or "Export failed. Please try again." with retry option. | | |
| S2S-19 | **Workspace Data Recovery**<br />‣ Attempt to load workspace with corrupted data<br />‣ Attempt to load workspace with only partial data available | System displays recovery options: "Unable to load workspace data" with fresh start option, or loads partial data with notification and options to continue or start fresh. | | |
